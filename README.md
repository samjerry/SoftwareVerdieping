Make a Coaster Shooter VR. This is a game where the player moves over a pre-determined path.
At the same time the player needs to defend himself against waves of enemies without the capability of moving.

## Software Analyse 
UE4: 
  pros:
    - Epic Games pays more attention to engine optimization, especially under VR and the UE has a built-in VR editor.
    - Possibility to work with C++ and/or Blueprints.
    - Comes packaged with some pretty prebuilt effects and assets.
    - Comes with "Matinee" this helps the VR experience feel more polished.
  
  cons:
    - Documentation is minimum.
    - Difficult to find examples of the classes and methods.
    - I’m not particularly familiar with C++.

Unity3D:
  pros:
    - Has a ton of great tutorials for beginners.
    - Searching on Google for an answer is easier with Unity questions versus Unreal ones.
    - Both Unity programming concepts and their API have great documentation.
    - Unity comes with two options for programming: C# and JavaScript.
    
  cons:
    - Trying to get threading working in Unity quickly seems challenging.
    - An older version of C#.
    
Conclusion: 
Overall, both engines are pretty easy to start ramping up in. Ultimately, I chose Unity3D because I prefer to work with C# since I do not have enough knowledge to work with C++.
